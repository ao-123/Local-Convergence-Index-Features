# Local-Convergence-Index-Features
Reimplementation of this paper with Python 

> Dashtbozorg B, Zhang J, Huang F, et al. [Retinal microaneurysms detection using local convergence index features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06865)[J]. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2018, 27(7): 3300-3315.

The experiment is in progress...

The source code scrips are not available from the authors due to commercial and copyright issues, thus this version of python code **should be used for academic purpose only**.

Please feel free to contact me (chibing.xiang@gmail.com) if you are  interested in or working on Diabetic Retinopathy detection, I am looking for cooperation with any interested partners.
